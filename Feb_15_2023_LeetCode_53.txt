Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
Explanation: The subarray [5,4,-1,7,8] has the largest sum 23.

First Attempt:

I tried to get every subarrays of list and compare them to get the maximum subarray
Code:
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        max = nums[0]
        for start in range(len(nums)):
            n = start+1
            sumNums = 0
            if start+1 == len(nums):
                if nums[start] >= max:
                    max = nums[start]
            else:
                while n < len(nums)+1:
                    sumNums = sum(nums[start:n])
                    if sumNums > max:
                        max = sumNums
                    n+=1
        return max
        
Feedback: It gives me a time limit exceed error. So I should find an algorithm with better time complexity.

Second Attempt:

Get the sum elements one by one from the beginning and if I get negative sum, I reset the sum to zero and start again, because subarray with sum
of negative numbers will not contribute to max sum of subarray. And compare current sum and max sum to get the final max sum.

Code:
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        maxSum = nums[0]
        curSum = 0

        for n in nums:
            if curSum < 0:
                curSum = 0
            curSum += n
            maxSum = max(maxSum, curSum)
        return maxSum
        
Feedback: It solves the question well Beats 77% with runtime, but memory occupation needs improvement which only beats 11% of total submissions.
