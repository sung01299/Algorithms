876. Middle of the Linked List

Related Topics: Linked List, Two Pointers

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.

Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.

First Attempt:

Code:

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        count = 0
        curr = head
        while curr.next != None:
            count+=1
            curr = curr.next
        for i in range(int((count+1)/2)):
            head = head.next
        return head
        
Feedbacks: First, I traversed through the linked list to get the number of elements in list. And then by number/2 times, I set head = head.next, and
then returned head, so it will return linked list from the middle of it.
