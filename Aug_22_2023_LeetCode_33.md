# 33. Search In Rotated Sorted Array
**Difficulty: Medium** 

*Related Topics: Array, Binary Search*

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1

## Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            
            ## find left portion
            if nums[l] <= nums[mid]:
                if target > nums[mid] or target < nums[l]:
                    l = mid + 1
                else:
                    r = mid - 1
            ## find right portion
            else:
                if target < nums[mid] or target > nums[r]:
                    r = mid - 1
                else:
                    l = mid + 1
        return -1
```
